<p class="h2">Online Payment</p>

<p>
  Members paying for full KCC membership including Canoeing Ireland membership
  will be processed on the Canoeing Ireland portal. You will need to log in to
  <a href="https://membership.canoe.ie/" target="_blank">Canoeing Ireland</a> to
  pay for your membership.
</p>

<p class="h2">KCC Only Membership (without Canoeing Ireland)</p>

<p>
  Only select payment via this option if you already have Canoeing Ireland
  membership through other means. E.g. through work or membership with another
  kayaking club. The KCC membership fee is €35. When selecting the payment link
  below, you will be redirected away from the KCC website to a secure payment
  page hosted by Stripe.
